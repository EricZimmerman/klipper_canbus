# CANboot

Canboot is a bootloader which can be used to flash firmware on your Toolhead board without resorting to jumpers and USB cables.

This can greatly simplify maintenance, and is seen by many as a great quality of life improvement.

Work is currently underway to introduce this functionality to Klipper via [this pr.](https://github.com/Klipper3d/klipper/pull/5420)


In the meantime [eddietheengineer](https://github.com/eddietheengineer) has an excellent guide on flashing the CANBoot firmware.
