# RS485

## **PI Setup**

These steps will get a Waveshare RS485 or similar CAN hat interface up and running.

### **SPI**

`sudo raspi-config`

1. Select Interfaces
   1. Select SPI
   1. Select Yes
1. Select Interfaces
   1. Select Serial
   1. Select Yes to both Options
Exit and reboot

### **CAN Network**

AS the CAN network does not already exist we need to create it.

To do this type ` sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces.d/can0 `

Add the following to the file

```bash
auto can0
iface can0 can static
    bitrate 250000
    up ifconfig $IFACE txqueuelen 128
    pre-up ip link set can0 type can bitrate 250000 
    pre-up ip link set can0 txqueuelen 128
```

and press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>X</kbd> to save.


### **Identify the Clock chip**

Look for the clock reference chip on the RS485 and read the number from the top, you will need to know this for the next step.

**Edit your /boot/config.txt**

Enter `sudo nano /boot/config.txt`

If your clock read 8mhz in the previous step add the following to the `[all]` section at the bottom of this file:

```bash
dtoverlay=mcp2515-can0,oscillator=8000000,interrupt=25,spimaxfrequency=1000000
dtoverlay=spi1-1cs
```

If it read 12mhz, enter the following instead
```bash
dtoverlay=mcp2515-can0,oscillator=12000000,interrupt=25,spimaxfrequency=2000000
dtoverlay=spi1-1cs
```
After completing this hit <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>X</kbd> to save, press <kbd>Y</kbd> to confirm changes and don't change the name!

Now you can enter `sudo reboot` to reboot the PI

### Suggested troubleshooting

1. If nothing shows up, try completely powering off printer and restarting it
2. Check that the toolboard is flashed to 250k instead of 500k to match the above.
